# oF-ShaderBoilerplate
A basic starting point for working with GLSL in openFrameworks (Xcode) because I don't love setting up oF projects for GLSL and I do love working with GLSL in oF.

update window size, GL version in => src/main.cpp

shader files in => bin/data/shaders/000/ => update `shaderPath` in ofApp.h
